\section*{Time Response}
The poles that closest the jw axis are more dominant.
\section*{Routh-Hurwitz Criteria}
\subsection*{Necessary but NOT sufficient condition for stability}
All coefficients must be same sign or no zeros should exist in characteristic equation.
\[q(s)=s^3-3s+2\]
It is directly unstable But if we want to find number of poles at the RHP put $\epsilon$.
\subsection*{Zero columns cases}
If there is zero occur in the routh array we can say immediately this system is  unstable. But computing how many roots at the right half plane is following;
\subsection*{Zero row cases}
Root locations that causes the this situation;
\subsubsection*{Symmetry at jw axis real roots}
\subsubsection*{At jw axis}
\subsubsection*{Quadrant both symetric at real and imaginary axis}
